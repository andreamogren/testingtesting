			<h1>Fun, fun, fun!</h1>
				<p>Do you want to feel the adrenaline rush through you veins? 
				   Maybe you think that simply exploring a forest by foot ”is for suckers” and you want to step up your game? 
				   Don’t worry, here are some adventures that are more exhilarating than relaxing:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.klattercentret.se/"> Climbing at Klättercentret</a> - Challenge yourself, go climbing today! Maybe you feel that you've spent to much time down on the ground, or you have a crippling fear of heights. 
					Either way, climbing is a fun and different way to exercise. Maybe a different (higher) perspective of life will give you some good insights?</li>
					<br>
					<li><a href="http://www.smcgokart.se/"> Gokart, frick yeah!</a> - Ever dreamed of becoming a race car driver? Or are you too young to have a driver's license?
					Why not try driving a gokart? Chase your dreams (or family members that you're annoyed at) down the race track!</li>
					<br>
					<li><a href="http://www.flottsbro.se/fdc"> Downhill cars</a> - Downhill cars for adults? What a time to be alive. Bring your child hood memories back to life while going on a 
						100 % enironmentally friendly car drive, no emissions, no gas, no nothing. Just you and your sweet ride.</li>
			</ul>
