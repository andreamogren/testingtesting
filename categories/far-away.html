			<h1>Stockholm's suburbs have lots to offer</h1>
			
				<p><i> Ever feel like you just wanted to get away from it all? Why not go for an adventure outside of town? 
			  	   Stockholm city has a lot to offer, but so do the suburbs. 
				   Here are adventures that let you escape the city stress and explore the outskirts of Stockholm:</i></p>
			<ul>
					
				<li><a href="http://bodyflight.se/">Body flight</a> - Who says humans can't fly? Go to Body flight in Bromma and you will learn how! 
				       Or well, you can learn how to levitate. Bodyflight STHLM has a great big windtunnel where you can practice your (levitating) skills!</li>
				<br>
				
				<li><a href="http://www.discgolfpark.com/"> Frisbeegolf </a> - Why not pay a visit to JÃ¤rva Discogolfpark (Discogolf!!) and play some frisbeegolf? 
				Find out for yourself if frisbee and golf make a dynamic duo. Are they as good together as peanut butter and jelly? Pancakes and syrup? Khal Drogo and Daenerys Targaryen?
